8.1 Force and Motion

Force is a push or a pull. When we push or pull an object, we are applying a force on it. 
Force can change the state of motion of an object. It can also change the shape of an object.

In our daily life, we apply force in many activities. When we open a door, we apply a push 
or pull force. When we ride a bicycle, we apply force on the pedals. Let us understand 
the effects of force through some activities.

ACTIVITY 8.1
Take a ball and place it on a table. Push the ball gently with your finger. What do you observe?
The ball starts moving in the direction of the push. This shows that force can set a stationary 
object in motion.

Now, while the ball is moving, give it another push in the same direction. What happens? 
The ball moves faster. This demonstrates that force can increase the speed of a moving object.

Next, while the ball is moving, push it from the side. The ball changes its direction. 
This shows that force can change the direction of motion.

Materials needed: A ball, a flat table
Time required: 10 minutes

From this activity, we learn important concepts about force and motion. These observations 
form the foundation for understanding Newton's laws of motion.

Example 8.1
A force of 10 N is applied to a box of mass 2 kg resting on a smooth surface. 
Calculate the acceleration of the box.

Solution:
We know from Newton's second law that F = ma
Where F = force, m = mass, a = acceleration

Given:
F = 10 N
m = 2 kg

Therefore, a = F/m = 10/2 = 5 m/s¬≤

The acceleration of the box is 5 m/s¬≤.

This example shows how we can quantify the effect of force on motion. The same principle 
applies whether we're analyzing the motion of a cricket ball, a car, or a spacecraft.

ACTIVITY 8.2
‡§ó‡§§‡§ø‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡§ø 8.2 - ‡§¨‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§ø‡§∂‡§æ
Take two identical toy cars. Place them side by side on a smooth surface. Push one car 
straight ahead and the other at an angle. Observe their paths.

What do you notice? The direction of force determines the direction of motion. This is an 
important principle in physics.

Fig. 8.1: Effect of force direction on motion
The diagram shows how different force directions produce different motions.

8.2 Types of Forces

Forces can be broadly classified into two categories:
1. Contact forces - Forces that act when objects are in physical contact
2. Non-contact forces - Forces that act even when objects are not touching

Contact forces include:
- Muscular force: The force we apply using our muscles
- Friction: The force that opposes relative motion between surfaces
- Normal force: The support force exerted by a surface

Let's explore these through an activity.

ACTIVITY 8.3
Push a book on your table. First push it on the smooth table surface, then place a rough 
cloth on the table and push the book again. 

In which case is it easier to push the book? You'll find it's easier on the smooth surface. 
This is because friction is less on smooth surfaces.

This activity helps us understand friction, which is an important contact force in our daily life.

Example 8.2
A car of mass 1000 kg is moving with a velocity of 20 m/s. The driver applies brakes and 
the car comes to rest in 5 seconds. Calculate the braking force.

Solution:
Initial velocity (u) = 20 m/s
Final velocity (v) = 0 m/s
Time (t) = 5 s
Mass (m) = 1000 kg

First, calculate acceleration:
a = (v - u)/t = (0 - 20)/5 = -4 m/s¬≤

The negative sign indicates deceleration.

Now, calculate force:
F = ma = 1000 √ó (-4) = -4000 N

The braking force is 4000 N (the negative sign indicates it opposes motion).

What you have learnt:
‚Ä¢ Force is a push or a pull
‚Ä¢ Force can change the state of motion of an object
‚Ä¢ Force can change the shape of an object
‚Ä¢ Forces can be contact or non-contact forces
‚Ä¢ The effect of force depends on its magnitude and direction
