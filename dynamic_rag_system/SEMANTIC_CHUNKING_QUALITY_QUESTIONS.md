## üìù The 10 Semantic Chunking Quality Questions

### **Q1: System Understanding**

- Educational structure recognition

**Expected chunk types:** `activity`, `content`

**Semantic aspects:** content_type_detection, boundary_identification, educational_structure

---

### **Q2: Boundary Testing**
**Question:** What happens when a single paragraph contains both an example and an explanation?

**Purpose:** Evaluates how the system handles mixed content within single text units.

**What it evaluates:**
- Mixed content separation
- Semantic coherence maintenance
- Boundary detection precision

**Expected chunk types:** `example`, `content`

**Semantic aspects:** content_separation, semantic_coherence, boundary_detection

---

### **Q3: Relationship Mapping**
**Question:** How does the system maintain relationships between related concepts across different chunks?

**Purpose:** Tests the system's ability to preserve conceptual connections across separated content.

**What it evaluates:**
- Cross-chunk relationship mapping
- Concept linking capabilities
- Semantic continuity preservation

**Expected chunk types:** `content`, `example`

**Semantic aspects:** relationship_mapping, concept_linking, semantic_continuity

---

### **Q4: Concept Demonstration**
**Question:** Can the chunker identify when an activity demonstrates a specific concept?

**Purpose:** Evaluates the system's ability to link practical activities with theoretical concepts.

**What it evaluates:**
- Activity-concept mapping
- Demonstration identification
- Practical application recognition

**Expected chunk types:** `activity`

**Semantic aspects:** concept_detection, activity_analysis, demonstration_mapping

---

### **Q5: Multi-Chunk Integration**
**Question:** How does the system handle questions that require understanding from multiple chunks?

**Purpose:** Tests the system's ability to integrate information across different content segments.

**What it evaluates:**
- Cross-chunk retrieval capabilities
- Information integration
- Comprehensive answer generation

**Expected chunk types:** `content`, `example`, `activity`

**Semantic aspects:** cross_chunk_retrieval, information_integration, comprehensive_answers

---

### **Q6: Boundary Ambiguity**
**Question:** What happens when content has ambiguous boundaries between different educational elements?

**Purpose:** Evaluates the system's handling of unclear content boundaries.

**What it evaluates:**
- Ambiguity resolution
- Boundary clarification
- Semantic precision

**Expected chunk types:** `content`, `special_box`

**Semantic aspects:** ambiguity_resolution, boundary_clarification, semantic_precision

---

### **Q7: Pedagogical Structure**
**Question:** How does the chunker preserve the educational flow and sequence of learning?

**Purpose:** Tests the system's ability to maintain the logical progression of educational content.

**What it evaluates:**
- Learning sequence preservation
- Pedagogical structure maintenance
- Educational flow continuity

**Expected chunk types:** `intro`, `content`, `summary`

**Semantic aspects:** sequence_preservation, pedagogical_structure, learning_progression

---

### **Q8: Prerequisite Mapping**
**Question:** Can the system identify when content builds upon previously introduced concepts?

**Purpose:** Evaluates the system's ability to detect knowledge dependencies and prerequisites.

**What it evaluates:**
- Prerequisite detection
- Concept building recognition
- Knowledge dependency mapping

**Expected chunk types:** `content`, `example`

**Semantic aspects:** prerequisite_analysis, dependency_mapping, concept_relationships

---

### **Q9: Hybrid Content**
**Question:** How does the chunker handle content that contains both theoretical and practical elements?

**Purpose:** Tests the system's ability to separate and classify mixed theoretical-practical content.

**What it evaluates:**
- Content hybridization handling
- Theoretical-practical separation
- Content integrity maintenance

**Expected chunk types:** `content`, `activity`

**Semantic aspects:** content_hybridization, theoretical_practical_separation, content_integrity

---

### **Q10: Concept Redundancy**
**Question:** What happens when the same concept is explained in multiple ways across different chunks?

**Purpose:** Evaluates the system's ability to handle and maintain consistency across redundant explanations.

**What it evaluates:**
- Redundancy detection
- Consistency maintenance
- Concept unification

**Expected chunk types:** `content`, `example`, `activity`

**Semantic aspects:** redundancy_detection, consistency_maintenance, concept_unification

---

## üìä Scoring System

### **Relevance Score Calculation**
Each question is scored based on:

1. **Chunk Type Match** (2.0 points): Does the retrieved chunk match expected types?
2. **Concept Overlap** (1.0 point per match): How well do concepts align?
3. **Semantic Aspect Coverage** (0.5 points per aspect): Are semantic aspects present?
4. **Content Quality** (0.5 points): Overall chunk quality contribution

### **Quality Grades**
- **A+ (Excellent):** 3.0+ average score
- **A (Very Good):** 2.5-2.99 average score  
- **B (Good):** 2.0-2.49 average score
- **C (Fair):** 1.5-1.99 average score
- **D (Poor):** <1.5 average score
