7.1 Describing Motion

Motion is everywhere around us. We observe motion in our daily life - birds flying, cars moving, leaves falling. But how do we describe motion scientifically?

To describe motion, we need to specify a reference point. An object is said to be in motion if it changes its position with respect to a reference point with time.

Distance is the actual length of the path traveled by an object. Displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions of the object.

Speed is the rate of change of distance with time, while velocity is the rate of change of displacement with time. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time.

ACTIVITY 7.1
Take a ball and place it on the ground. Mark the position as point O. Now push the ball and let it roll to point A. 

Materials needed: A ball, measuring tape, stopwatch
Time required: 15 minutes

Observe and note:
‚Ä¢ Distance traveled by the ball
‚Ä¢ Time taken to travel from O to A
‚Ä¢ Direction of motion

From this activity, we learn that motion involves change in position with time, and we can measure both distance and time to understand motion better.

DO YOU KNOW?
The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses the concept of relative motion to determine your location. GPS satellites constantly broadcast their position and time, and your GPS receiver calculates your position based on signals from multiple satellites.

Example 7.1
A car travels from city A to city B, a distance of 100 km, in 2 hours. Then it travels from city B to city C, covering 80 km in 1.5 hours. Calculate the average speed for the entire journey.

Given:
Distance AB = 100 km, Time AB = 2 hours
Distance BC = 80 km, Time BC = 1.5 hours

Solution:
Total distance = 100 + 80 = 180 km
Total time = 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 hours
Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 180 / 3.5 = 51.4 km/h

Therefore, the average speed for the entire journey is 51.4 km/h.

Real-world Applications:
‚Ä¢ Transportation systems use speed calculations for scheduling
‚Ä¢ Sports analysis relies on velocity and acceleration measurements  
‚Ä¢ Navigation systems calculate optimal routes using motion principles
‚Ä¢ Safety systems in vehicles use acceleration data for airbag deployment

THINK AND ACT
1. Observe five different types of motion in your surroundings
2. Measure the speed of a moving object (like a bicycle or car) safely
3. Design an experiment to demonstrate relative motion
4. Research how motion sensors work in automatic doors

Questions
1. What is the difference between distance and displacement?
2. A student walks 4 meters east, then 3 meters north. What is the distance and displacement?
3. If a car travels 60 km in 1 hour, what is its speed? If it maintains the same direction, what is its velocity?
4. Give two examples each of uniform and non-uniform motion.

Multiple Choice Questions
1. The SI unit of speed is:
   (a) m/s¬≤    (b) m/s    (c) km/h    (d) m

2. Which of the following is a vector quantity?
   (a) Distance    (b) Speed    (c) Displacement    (d) Time

What you have learnt
‚Ä¢ Motion is the change in position of an object with time
‚Ä¢ Distance is scalar, displacement is vector
‚Ä¢ Speed is scalar, velocity is vector  
‚Ä¢ We need a reference point to describe motion
‚Ä¢ Motion can be uniform or non-uniform
‚Ä¢ Average speed = Total distance / Total time
‚Ä¢ Motion concepts have many real-world applications

Remember: Motion and rest are relative terms - an object can be at rest relative to one observer and in motion relative to another.

Key Points to Remember:
‚Ä¢ Always specify the reference point when describing motion
‚Ä¢ Distance is always positive, displacement can be positive or negative
‚Ä¢ Speed is always positive, velocity can have direction
‚Ä¢ Acceleration occurs when velocity changes
