7.1 Motion and Rest

Motion is everywhere around us. The leaves of trees move, birds fly, fish swim, and children play. 
Even when we are sleeping, air moves into and out of our lungs and blood flows in arteries and veins.

ACTIVITY 7.1
Take a ball and place it on the ground. Is the ball in motion or at rest?
Now push the ball. What do you observe? The ball starts moving.
Stop the ball with your hand. Now the ball is at rest again.

From this activity, we learn that:
‚Ä¢ Objects can be in motion or at rest
‚Ä¢ Motion and rest are relative terms
‚Ä¢ An object can change from rest to motion and vice versa

Materials needed: A ball, open space
Time required: 5 minutes
Safety note: Ensure the area is clear of obstacles

DO YOU KNOW?
The study of motion without considering the forces that cause it is called kinematics. 
Ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle and later scientists like Galileo contributed 
significantly to our understanding of motion.

Example 7.1
A car travels from Delhi to Agra. During the journey:
- With respect to the road, the car is in motion
- With respect to the passengers inside, the car is at rest
- With respect to the trees on the roadside, the car is in motion

Solution:
This example demonstrates that motion is relative. The state of motion depends on 
the observer or the reference point chosen.

THINK AND ACT
1. List five objects in motion around you right now.
2. List five objects at rest around you right now.  
3. Explain why the same object can be considered both in motion and at rest.
4. Give examples from your daily life where motion is relative.

Questions
1. What is motion? Give two examples of objects in motion.
2. What is rest? Give two examples of objects at rest.
3. Why do we say motion and rest are relative terms?
4. A passenger sitting in a moving train is at rest with respect to what?
5. The same passenger is in motion with respect to what?

Multiple Choice Questions
1. Motion is:
   (a) Absolute    (b) Relative    (c) Fixed    (d) Constant

2. An object at rest has:
   (a) Zero motion    (b) Constant motion    (c) No motion relative to observer    (d) All of these

What you have learnt
‚Ä¢ Motion and rest are relative terms
‚Ä¢ An object can be in motion with respect to one observer and at rest with respect to another
‚Ä¢ The state of motion depends on the reference point or observer
‚Ä¢ Everything in the universe is in motion relative to something
‚Ä¢ We need to specify the reference point when describing motion
‚Ä¢ Motion is a fundamental property of matter and is observed everywhere in nature

Remember: There is no absolute rest or absolute motion in the universe. Everything is relative!
