8.1 Force and Motion

Force is a push or a pull. When we push or pull an object, we are applying a force on it. 
Force can change the state of motion of an object. It can also change the shape of an object.

In our daily life, we apply force in many activities. When we open a door, we apply a push 
or pull force. When we ride a bicycle, we apply force on the pedals.

ACTIVITY 8.1
Take a ball and place it on a table. Push the ball gently with your finger. What do you observe?
The ball starts moving in the direction of the push. This shows that force can set a stationary 
object in motion.

Now, while the ball is moving, give it another push in the same direction. What happens? 
The ball moves faster. This demonstrates that force can increase the speed of a moving object.

Materials needed: A ball, a flat table
Time required: 10 minutes

From this activity, we learn important concepts about force and motion. These observations 
form the foundation for understanding Newton's laws of motion.

DO YOU KNOW?
The concept of force was first formalized by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century. 
Newton's laws of motion form the foundation of classical mechanics and are still 
used today to understand motion in our everyday world.

Fig. 8.1: Effect of force on motion
The diagram shows a ball being pushed by a finger. The ball moves in the direction 
of the applied force, demonstrating that force can cause motion.

Example 8.1
A force of 10 N is applied to a box of mass 2 kg resting on a smooth surface. 
Calculate the acceleration of the box.

Solution:
We know from Newton's second law that:
F = ma

Where:
F = force applied = 10 N
m = mass of object = 2 kg
a = acceleration = ?

Therefore:
a = F/m = 10/2 = 5 m/s¬≤

The acceleration of the box is 5 m/s¬≤.

This example shows how we can quantify the effect of force on motion using mathematical 
relationships. The same principle applies whether we're analyzing the motion of a cricket 
ball, a car, or a spacecraft.

THINK AND ACT
1. List five examples of forces you observe in your daily life.
2. Explain how force affects the motion of objects around you.
3. Design an experiment to demonstrate that force can change the direction of motion.

Questions
1. What is force? Give two examples of forces.
2. How does force affect the motion of an object?
3. A car of mass 1000 kg accelerates at 2 m/s¬≤. What force is applied?
4. State Newton's second law of motion.

Figure 8.2: Types of forces
This diagram illustrates different types of forces: contact forces (friction, normal force) 
and non-contact forces (gravitational, magnetic, electrical).

The mathematical relationship between force, mass, and acceleration can be expressed as:

F = ma

This is Newton's second law of motion, one of the most fundamental equations in physics.

8.2 Types of Forces

Forces can be broadly classified into two categories based on whether the objects 
need to be in contact or not.

What you have learnt
‚Ä¢ Force is a push or a pull that can change the state of motion of an object
‚Ä¢ Force can also change the shape of an object
‚Ä¢ Newton's second law states that F = ma
‚Ä¢ The SI unit of force is Newton (N)
‚Ä¢ Forces can be classified as contact and non-contact forces
‚Ä¢ Motion is always relative to a reference frame

Remember: Force is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. 
The direction of force is as important as its magnitude in determining the effect on motion.
