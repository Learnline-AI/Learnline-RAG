7.1 Describing Motion

Motion is common to everything in the universe. Everything we see around us like 
books, blackboards, people, plants, animals, buses, cars, etc., can be in a state 
of rest or motion. Even things that appear to be at rest are in motion.

The birds fly, fish swim, blood flows through our veins and arteries. The earth 
rotates on its axis and also revolves around the sun. The whole solar system 
moves in the galaxy. Thus, motion is an essential characteristic of matter.

How do we describe the motion of an object? How can we say that something is 
moving faster than the other? These questions can be answered after studying 
this chapter.

To describe motion, we need to specify the position of an object. The position 
of an object is described by specifying a reference point. For example, a 
passenger sitting in a moving bus is at rest with respect to the bus, but is 
in motion with respect to objects outside the bus like buildings, trees, etc.

ACTIVITY 7.1
Observe various objects around you which are at rest, for example, your study 
table, a book lying on the table, a picture on the wall of your room, etc.

Now observe various objects around you which are in motion, for example, a moving 
car, a flying bird, a flowing river, a moving cloud, your sister/brother walking 
in the room, etc.

From your observations, can you conclude that rest and motion are relative terms? 
Discuss with your friends and teachers.

From this activity, we understand that motion is relative. What appears to be at 
rest from one reference point may appear to be in motion from another reference 
point. This is an important concept in physics.

Example 7.1
A passenger in a moving bus observes that a passenger in another bus appears to 
be moving backwards. However, a person standing on the road observes both buses 
moving forward. Explain this observation.

Solution:
This observation can be explained using the concept of relative motion. The 
passenger's reference frame is his own bus. Since the other bus is moving slower 
(or the observer's bus is moving faster), the other bus appears to move backwards 
relative to the observer.

From the reference frame of a person standing on the road, both buses are moving 
in the forward direction. This demonstrates that motion is always described 
relative to a chosen reference frame.

7.2 Measuring the Rate of Motion

How fast or slow an object moves is described by its speed. When we say that a 
car is moving at 60 km/h, we are describing its speed. Speed tells us how much 
distance is covered by an object in unit time.

The speed of an object is defined as the distance travelled by the object in 
unit time.

Speed = Distance travelled / Time taken

The SI unit of speed is metre per second (m/s). Other common units include 
kilometre per hour (km/h).

There is a difference between speed and velocity. Speed is a scalar quantity 
- it has only magnitude. Velocity is a vector quantity - it has both magnitude 
and direction.

ACTIVITY 7.2
Take a toy car and mark its position at different time intervals as it moves 
on a straight path. Calculate the distance covered in equal intervals of time.

Observe:
- Does the car cover equal distances in equal intervals of time?
- What does this tell you about the motion of the car?
- Can you calculate the average speed of the car?

This activity helps us understand uniform and non-uniform motion. When an object 
covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to have uniform motion.

Example 7.2
A car travels a distance of 100 km in 2 hours. Calculate its average speed.

Solution:
Distance travelled = 100 km
Time taken = 2 hours

Average speed = Distance travelled / Time taken
                = 100 km / 2 hours
                = 50 km/h

Therefore, the average speed of the car is 50 km/h.

This calculation gives us the average speed. The actual speed at any instant may 
be different from the average speed.
